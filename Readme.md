# Closest pairs finder

This Python program allows you to find the closest pairs of points in a 2D plane using two modes:
1. **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: An interactive interface where you can click to add points and find the closest pairs.
2. **Standalone Script**: A non-GUI version that runs directly and computes the closest pairs for predefined points. You can edit the points and number of closest pairs by modifying the script.

## Requirements

Before running the program, make sure to install the required dependencies using `pip`.

### Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install matplotlib numpy tkinter
